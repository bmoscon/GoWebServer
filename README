Very Simple Go Web Server

you can build like so:

go build go_web_server.go

run, and then go to "localhost:8080/" + whatever path you want. 

Webserver will display simple message in HTML page

Config file will need to be created. GWS expects to find it in cfg/gws.cfg
format is as follows:
root=<path to website root>
error=<file that will be output in event of a bad request, should be in cfg/>
